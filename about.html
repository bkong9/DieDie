  		<!-- self intro -->
  		<p>Hi, I am Mary. I was born in China. When I was fifteen, I immigrated to Canada with my family. I have always been a nerd growing up and lacks vision with regards to my future plan. However, the desire for adventure has been inside of me the entire time. When younger me talked about wanting to travel around the world, I was not serious about it. Little did I know that one day I am much closer to fulfilling it than I would have dreamt.</p>

  		<p>Since I graduated from university, I have set foot on 12 of the 13 provinces and territories in Canada and close to half of the 50 States of America. Outside of North America, I have travelled to Asia, South America, Europe, and even Antarctica. I went from an otaku to an experienced outdoorsman. Other than taking photos, I have also ridden a snowmobile, tried paragliding, and swam with dolphins. Now I can confidently say that there is not much I will not try, because travelling has taught me I am way more capable than I thought.</p>

  		<p>When it comes to photography, I got my first DSLR camera when I was fourteen. It was just a hobby at the time. For a few years, all I did was mess around with it. Till this day, I have never learned photography or photo editing systematically. Everything I know was self-taught with the help of the internet. However, as I started travelling more frequently, I realized it would be a waste to not record all the wonders I see on the road. The more I experience, the more I appreciate the sheer beauty of nature. Therefore, my camera bag has gotten heavier, my hard drive has gotten fuller, and my love for nature continues to grow.</p>

  		<p>I wanted to use this website as an archive for all the photos I have taken in the past 5 years. Thank you all for taking your time to view them. I really appreciate it. </p>
